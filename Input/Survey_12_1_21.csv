This research program has been highlighted as a topic of interest as part of the SEEDS sustainability program at UBC. We will be seeking out UBC students to participate in this survey to have a general idea of how birds are perceived on campus and what bird attributes are valued the most. It will take you ~7 minutes to finish this Qualtrics survey. The survey questions will address key elements regarding values related to bird diversity on campus. We will ask you questions regarding your knowledge of and experience with birds on campus, and your personal opinions about what kind of birds should receive priority when designing bird-specific habitats on campus. Participating in this survey is optional and completely up to you. However, we highly appreciate your input and sincerely hope you could spare some time to answer the survey questions as this project will inform a more bird-friendly campus. There will be no direct risk to you from participation in this study. 
Responses are collected anonymously and no identifying information is needed. The only people who will see your answers are the student researchers and the course instructor (Professor Leila Harris). All survey responses will be kept without the name of the participant in an encrypted document and saved on an encrypted server at the University of British Columbia. The students undertaking this research are enrolled in RES 510, Socio-ecological Systems. SEEDS staff and members of the Campus and Community planning team are interested in the results of this work. 
Questions about the study should be directed to the instructor for RES 510, Dr. Leila Harris: lharris@ires.ubc.ca. If you have any concerns or complaints about your rights as a research participant and/or your experiences while participating in this study, please contact the Research Participant Complaint Line in the UBC Office of Research Ethics at 604-822-8598, e-mail RSIL@ors.ubc.ca, or call toll-free 1-877-822-8598.
